### What I learned

I had a slightly difficult time creating the overlay hover effect. I initially used the ::after pseudo element; however, I couldn't get it to only appear once hovered. I played with the display and nested propertie, but it still didn't work. I really didn't want to create another div just for the overlay, but I ended up doing that. The opacity and alpha channel was a nice final touch. I probably could've made the hover effect work if I had applied opacity and alpha channel with the ::after  pseud oelement. 

see below for code snippets:


```css
.overlay {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
    aspect-ratio: 1;
    border-radius: 7px;
    background: hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.5);
    padding: 110px;
    opacity: 0;
    transition: all 0.25s ease;
}

.overlay:hover {
    opacity: 1;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

I am currently learning javascript. For now, I will continue my classes on Javasript, while perfecting my html and css skills. I'll move up from building components to building full static sites.
